### Q&A

1. **Why corn?**

    Because corn appears everywhere! The idea comes from a book called *The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals*.

1. **Will you visit cornhub?**

    ~~Of course.~~

1. **Where are you from?**

    Taiwan. To make things simple: I'm from Taipei, Taiwan.

1. **What is your school?**

    I attended an experimental school for both elementary and middle school called **ç‚«å¿ƒæ˜Ÿ**. (In English, you can call it *Awesome Star*.)  
    My high school was **Fanghe**, aâ€¦ *cool* school.  
    As for college, I'm currently studying at **NCU**.

1. **Do you use Instagram?**

    Emmm... Good question. I have an account, but I never really use it. (Actually, it was banned around May, about three months ago, saying I'm a robot.)

    If you want to contact me, use **Discord** or **LINE** instead.
